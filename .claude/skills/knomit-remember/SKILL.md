# /knomit-remember

## When to use — trigger phrases

Fire WHEN any of these occur:

- **You just discovered something** during exploration that isn't obvious from the code. Signal phrases in your own thinking: "oh, that's why…", "I didn't realize…", "the actual reason is…", "it turns out…".
- **The user corrected you on a project fact.** Signal phrases from the user: "actually X", "no, it's Y", "wait, that's wrong", "the threshold is Z, not W".
- **A bug fix exposed a hidden invariant** — the bug only happens when a non-obvious precondition is violated.
- **You're about to claim X exists** based on a memory or training-data guess — if you had to verify it, that's a discovery worth keeping.

For **predictions** (something that *might* be true but isn't observed yet): write as a fact with `type: hypothesis` instead of `observation`. Hypotheses carry uncertainty and trigger the confirm/retract lifecycle on dedup collisions.

DON'T fire for:

- Trivial restatements of code that's already self-evident
- Information that belongs in CLAUDE.md (project conventions, file placement)
- One-off task details (in-progress state, current conversation context)

## How

1. Run `knomit_query` on the would-be title to surface similar or contradicting existing facts.
2. If a contradicting fact exists: ASK the user whether to `/knomit-update`, `/knomit-retract`, or merge — don't write a duplicate.
3. Otherwise call `knomit_learn` with: `topic`, `category`, `title`, `body`, `kind` (default epistemic), `type` (default observation; use `hypothesis` for predictions), `entities`, `refs`, `confidence` 0.85.

## Body authoring contract — write it so it can't compress into a falsehood

Consumers act on the slogan they compress a fact into, not on the fact itself (see /knomit-harden). Author every body to survive a hurried reader:

1. **Name every component of compound conditions** — quote keys and conditions verbatim from the code ("keyed by (path, blob_hash)"), never a catchier paraphrase ("content-addressed"). The dropped component is how a true fact becomes a false slogan.
2. **State the operational consequence** — what a consumer should do, or must never do, because this is true.
3. **Name the foreseeable misreading** — if you can already see the convenient-but-false corollary a hurried reader would draw, add a "WHAT THIS DOES NOT MEAN" line naming it and why it's false.
4. **Anchor invariants to enforcing code** — a fact under `invariants/` without a `src://` ref to the code that *enforces* it (not just where you noticed it) is a /knomit-harden finding at birth. Add the ref now.

Discipline: name only misreadings you can actually foresee — a fact drowning in speculative caveats is a different failure mode.

## Ref format for source files (IMPORTANT)

Source refs are `src://<repo-id>/<path>@<commit>:<blob>`. Produce the three
components from the repo you are citing:

```bash
git rev-list --max-parents=0 HEAD | cut -c1-12   # <repo-id>
git rev-parse HEAD                                # <commit>, full 40 hex
git rev-parse <commit>:<path>                     # <blob>, full 40 hex
```

**Which id?** `<repo-id>` in a `src://` ref is the **source repo's** root commit,
computed by running git in the checkout you are citing — it is NOT a knomit repo
id, and it is the only id you ever supply.

For `kb://` refs you never build an id at all. Cite a fact in this repo by its
bare path; knomit rewrites it to the canonical `kb://<repo-id>/<path>` form on
write. Cite a fact in another repo by copying the `kb://<id>/…` path verbatim
from the query or explain result that gave it to you.

That last command FAILING is the check: it means the file did not exist at that
commit. **Never cite source that does not exist in the repo's history** — knomit
holds fact blobs only, never source, so it cannot verify a src ref for you.

Add `#L<start>-L<end>` when the fact is about specific lines rather than a whole
file. The blob is what makes the citation durable: `git cat-file blob <blob>`
returns the exact bytes even after the file is renamed or deleted, which a
commit-only ref cannot.

The older `src://<name>/<path>@<commit>` form is still accepted everywhere and
is never rewritten — don't "fix" existing refs in that form.

A `kb/…` ref must resolve when the call lands, or knomit REJECTS the whole call.
All facts in ONE knomit_learn call are committed together, so facts written in
the same call may cite each other in any order — including circularly. Only
citations ACROSS calls must point at facts that already exist. When writing a
set of interlinked facts, write them in one call.

Example: `src://7b4887ce51d9/internal/store/service.go@4154e92c8ff333435fd00c442489e855e4c3331e:36b1d45187d6a2c6ad18d591142227ad2a02a66e`

NEVER write bare paths like `internal/store/service.go` — knomit's ref resolver treats unscheme'd strings as local fact paths and lookups will fail or clash.

## Linking to another fact

To reference another knomit fact, put its fact path (the `kb/<topic>/<category>/<uuid>.md` shown in query results) in `refs` — same field as source refs, no scheme. There is NO inline link syntax: `[[name]]` and `[text](path)` are stored as literal body text and resolve to nothing.

(`[[name]]` is the *file-based auto-memory* convention — a different system. Don't carry it into knomit facts.)
