# /knomit-update <fact-path>

Use when:

- `/knomit-why` exposed drift between a fact and HEAD
- Code you just edited makes part of an existing fact wrong
- New evidence raises or lowers the confidence of an existing claim
- A signal phrase from the user: "that fact is out of date", "update the X fact", "the threshold is now Y"

DON'T use for:

- A new, related observation — use `/knomit-remember`
- A fact that is wholly wrong or supersedes — use `/knomit-retract` (and then `/knomit-remember` if a replacement is warranted)
- Renaming the topic/category — the fact path is fixed at creation; retract + relearn instead

## How

Call `knomit_update` with:

- `file`: the fact path (e.g. `kb/decisions/synthesize/.../<uuid>.md`)
- `moment_name`: short label (e.g. `"post-rename dirtyFacts → dirty"`)
- `updates`: ONLY the changed fields (partial)

Common partial updates:

| Change | Field |
|---|---|
| Body text drifted | `body` |
| Add, refresh, or drop source anchors | `refs` (REPLACES the whole list — send every ref the fact should keep) |
| Evidence corroborated | `confidence` up, `sources` += new count |
| Evidence weakened | `confidence` down |
| Wrong topic/category | NOT possible via update — retract + relearn |

## Body updates replace the WHOLE body — preserve hardening

`updates.body` replaces the entire body, not a section of it. When the existing fact carries a "WHAT THIS DOES NOT MEAN" section or fully-enumerated compound conditions (typically added by /knomit-harden), carry them into the new body unchanged unless your evidence specifically disproves them. A routine drift fix that drops these sections silently un-hardens the fact.

## Ref format reminder

Source refs are `src://<repo-id>/<path>@<commit>:<blob>`. Produce the three
components from the repo you are citing:

```bash
git rev-list --max-parents=0 HEAD | cut -c1-12   # <repo-id>
git rev-parse HEAD                                # <commit>, full 40 hex
git rev-parse <commit>:<path>                     # <blob>, full 40 hex
```

**Which id?** `<repo-id>` in a `src://` ref is the **source repo's** root commit,
computed by running git in the checkout you are citing — it is NOT a knomit repo
id, and it is the only id you ever supply.

For `kb://` refs you never build an id at all. Cite a fact in this repo by its
bare path; knomit rewrites it to the canonical `kb://<repo-id>/<path>` form on
write. Cite a fact in another repo by copying the `kb://<id>/…` path verbatim
from the query or explain result that gave it to you.

That last command FAILING is the check: it means the file did not exist at that
commit. **Never cite source that does not exist in the repo's history** — knomit
holds fact blobs only, never source, so it cannot verify a src ref for you.

Add `#L<start>-L<end>` when the fact is about specific lines rather than a whole
file. The blob is what makes the citation durable: `git cat-file blob <blob>`
returns the exact bytes even after the file is renamed or deleted, which a
commit-only ref cannot.

The older `src://<name>/<path>@<commit>` form is still accepted everywhere and
is never rewritten — don't "fix" existing refs in that form.

A `kb/…` ref must resolve when the call lands, or knomit REJECTS the whole call.
All facts in ONE knomit_learn call are committed together, so facts written in
the same call may cite each other in any order — including circularly. Only
citations ACROSS calls must point at facts that already exist. When writing a
set of interlinked facts, write them in one call.

## Refs REPLACE the whole list

`updates.refs` replaces the entire list — any existing ref you leave out is DROPPED. Read the fact's current refs first (`knomit_explain` or query output), then resend the full merged list: every ref to keep, plus fresh anchors, minus stale ones. Omit the `refs` field entirely to leave refs untouched.

Dropping a ref only affects this and future revisions — prior revisions keep their refs in git history and their DERIVED_FROM provenance edges, so replacing refs never erases past provenance.
